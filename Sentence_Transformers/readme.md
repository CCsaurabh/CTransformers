### Limitation of Current Sentence Transformer based document similarity comparison

1. Existing approaches represent a document with a single vector in the embedding space.This leads to a single notion of document similarity
which neglects the many meanings represented within a document.

2. [Augmented SBERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08240.pdf) : Cross Encoders are used to prepare the silver datasets from gold datasets which is then sampled and used to finetune the bi-encoders.

### Experiments considering above limitations
